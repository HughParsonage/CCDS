This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## R Markdown
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Australia's 2016 election

```{r packages}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(dtplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)

```

```{r loadData}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place <-
fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-20499.csv")

```
(To run a chunk, type `Ctrl + C` when your cursor is in the chunk.)

```{r basic-analysis}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = mean(Swing))
```

###Exercise
1. Can you think of a better way to calculate the 'average'swing against the incumbent?
2. Which polling place had the biggest swing against the Coalition?
3. Which polling place had the biggest swing agianst the Coalition?

We shouldn't weigh every polling place equally. A swing of 15 per cent in a polling place with 33 votes shouldn't swamp swings of 2 per cent in a polling place iwth 2000 votes. We use `weighted.mean` with `w = TotalVotes` to get around this:
### (2)

```{r average-swing}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = weighted.mean(Swing, w=TotalVotes))
```

Recall that `summarise` takes a data frame, and an expression like `LHS = RHS` where `LHS` is the column name and `RHS` is a function of the column names in the data, returning a data frame with a single column, `LHS` which ahs the value of the function `RHS`.

### (3)
```{r biggest-swing-Coalition}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  filter(Swing ==max(Swing))
```

## 2013 election
1. Download the 2013 election polling place data
2. Create a new object 'two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013' containing the data.

```{r polling-place}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 <-
  fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-17496.csv")
```
2. Determine (without downloading the relevant dataset!) the elcted party (ALP or Coalition) of each Division in 2013

Take the dataset `group_by` the Division, then `summarise` by adding up all the libleral/coalition votes (ensuring we sue backticks because the variable contains a slash and speces) and dividing by the sum of the total votes. Then use `mutate` to add a column, and `if_else` to conditionally assign the elected party.


```{r elected-party-by-Division-2013}
elected_party_by_Division_2013 <-
  two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 %>%
  group_by(DivisionNm) %>%
  summarise(Coalition_2PP = sum(`Liberal/National Coalition Votes`)/
              sum(TotalVotes)) %>%
mutate(elected = if_else(Coalition_2PP > 0.5, "Coalition","ALP"))
```

``` {r}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  # joins on all common names
  inner_join(elected_party_by_Division_2013)  #right_join or a left_join (for an outer join (inner will leave out anything missing on one side)) 
  
```
Let's try to confirm that `Swing` in `two_party_preferred_by_polling_place` is in fact the swing against the Coalition. That is, the percentage of votes to Coalition minus the percentage votes to Coalition in 2013 equals `Swing` in 2016.

`select` isn't quite good enough, so let's set an option:

```{r}
options(dplyr.width = Inf)
```

```{r polling-place-biggest-swing}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid <- 
  two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013, by = "PollingPlaceID") %>%
  tbl_df %>%  # for prettier printing
  mutate(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes = `Liberal/National Coalition Percentage.x` - `Liberal/National Coalition Percentage.y`) %>%
  # contains inside select means 'select columns whose names contain that string'
  select(PollingPlaceID, contains("Percentage"), ppt_diff_Coalition_votes, Swing.x) 
```

```{r}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid %>%
  # select random sample
  sample_n(10)
```

```{r}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid %$%
  # Check both columns have the same sign.
  # Using {} allows you to use multiple columns after %$%.
  # stopifnot(...) stops (i.e. errors) if any of the conditions are not met.
  # {stopifnot(all(sign(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes) == sign(Swing.x)))}
  {all(sign(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes) == sign(Swing.x))} ## FALSE
```

Where is the sign not the same?
```{r}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid %>%
  # Subset this table where the signs are different
  filter(sign(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes) != sign(Swing.x)) %>%
  # How many rows?
  nrow
```

What proportion of the rows have different signs? We can use `mean` cunningly to test the proportion of `TRUE`s in a column of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s.

```{r}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid %$%
  # Average rate where signs are not the same.
  mean(sign(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes) != sign(Swing.x))
```

Conclusion: `Swing.x` and `ppts_diff_Coalition_votes` are different.

```{r}
difference_and_swing_by_pollingplaceid %>%
  arrange(desc(ppt_diff_Coalition_votes)) %>%
  head(1) %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place, by = "PollingPlaceID")
```



Why can't we use `cbind` as opposed to `inner_join`? Because the PollingPlaceID may not be in the same order: you'll compare different polling places. `cbind` simply smooshes the two tables together.

## Is an inner join appropriate? Should we use a left/right (outer) join (or a full join) instead?

Yes, it's fine! Swings for newly created or no longer existent polling places aren't well-defined. So we can restrict to only those polling places which were present in both elections.

# Plotting charts of election results
Go to the AEC website, find
`http://results.ace.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/GeneralPollingPlacesDownload-20499.csv`

```{r}
polling_places <-
  fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/GeneralPollingPlacesDownload-20499.csv")
```

Think about a plan to plot the result in a map of each polling place's result. Not the actual plot mechanis, but what data you would need to do this

LAt/Long dataset of polling places for each site ID

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
polling_places %>%
  select(PollingPlaceID, Latitude, Longitude) %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place, by = "PollingPlaceID") %>%
  mutate(Winner = if_else(`Liberal/National Coalition Percentage` > 50, "Coalition", "ALP"))  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Longitude, y= Latitude, colour=Winner)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_map()
```

Let's plot a function to zoom in to a city

```{r}
library('mapproj')
plotmelb <- function () { 
  polling_places %>%
  select(PollingPlaceID, Latitude, Longitude) %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place, by = "PollingPlaceID") %>%
  mutate(Winner = if_else(`Liberal/National Coalition Percentage` > 50, "Coalition", "ALP"))  %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=Longitude, y= Latitude, colour=Winner)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_map() +
    
  coord_map(xlim=c(144.5, 145.6),
            ylim=c(-38.2, -37.5))
}

```


```{r}
library('mapproj')
plot_syd <- function () { 
  polling_places %>%
  select(PollingPlaceID, Latitude, Longitude) %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place, by = "PollingPlaceID") %>%
  mutate(Winner = if_else(`Liberal/National Coalition Percentage` > 50, "Coalition", "ALP"))  %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=Longitude, y= Latitude, colour=Winner)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_map() +
    
  coord_map(xlim=c(150.55, 151.6),
            ylim=c(-32.24, -33.6))
}

```

```{r}
plot_city <- function(city){
  if(city=="MELB") {
    plotmelb()
  }
  if(city=="SYD") {
    plot_syd()
  }
}
```

``` {r}
unabbreviate_city <- function(abbrev){
  #switch chooses the outcome
  #that its first argument selects.
  switch(abbev,
         "SYD" = "Sydney"
         "MEL" = "Melbourne",
         "unknown")  
  }  
}
```
