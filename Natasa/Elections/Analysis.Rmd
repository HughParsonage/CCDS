## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Australia's 2016 Election

```{r packages}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(dtplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
```

The function 'fread' comes from the 'data.table' package. The first argument is either a file (like a 'csv' file) or a URL connection to a file.

```{r loadData}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place <-
  fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-20499.csv")
```

# dplyr

## Basic election results

```{r basic-analysis}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = mean(Swing))
```

# Exercises:
1. Can you think of a better way to calculate the 'average' swing against the incumbent?
2. Can you think of a better way to calculate the 'average' swing?
3. Which polling place had the biggest swing against the Coalition?

We shouldn't weigh every polling place equally. A swing of 15 per cent in a polling place with 33 votes shouldn't swamp swings of 2 per cent in a polling place with 2000 votes. We use 'weighted.mean' with 'w = TotalVotes' to get around this:

### (2)
```{r average-swing}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = weighted.mean(Swing, w = TotalVotes))
```

Recall that 'summarise' takes a data frame, and an expression like 'LHS = RHS' where 'LHS' is the column name and 'RHS' is a function of the column names in the data, returning a data frame with a single column, 'LHS' which has the value of the function 'RHS'.

### (3)
```{r biggest-swing-Coalition}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  filter(Swing == max(Swing))
```

# Can't finish the exercise as we need more data

## 2013 election

### Exercise:
1. Download the 2013 election polling place data. Create a new object 'two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013' containing the data.

```{r}
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 <-
  fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-17496.csv")
```

2. Determine (without downloading the relevant dataset!) the elected party (ALP or Coalition) of each Division in 2013.

Take the dataset, 'group_by' the Division, then 'summarise' by adding up all the Liberal/Coalition votes (ensuring we use backticks because the variable contains a slash and spaces) and dividing by the sum of total votes. Then use 'mutate' to add a column, and 'if_else' to conditionally assign the elected party.

```{r elected-party-by-Division-2013}
elected_party_by_Division_2013 <-
  two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 %>%
  group_by(DivisionNm) %>%
  summarise(Coalition_2PP = sum(`Liberal/National Coalition Votes`) / sum(TotalVotes)) %>%
  mutate(elected = if_else(Coalition_2PP > 0.5, "Coalition", "ALP"))
```

### Homework
## What polling place has the biggest swing against the Coalition? (Note: not Division, so you may need to amend the previous code...)
## Is an inner join appropriate? Should we use a left/right (outer) join instead?

```{r biggest swing against the Coalition}
biggest_swing_against_the_Coalition <-
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  inner_join(two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013, by = "PollingPlaceID") %>%
  filter(TotalVotes.x > 0 & TotalVotes.y > 0) %>%
  filter(Swing.x == min(Swing.x))
```
