## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(dtplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r loadData}

two_party_preferred_by_polling_place <- fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-20499.csv", skip=1)

two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 <- fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-17496.csv", skip=1)

```

``` {r basic-analysis}

two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = mean(Swing))

```

### Exercises:
1. We should calculate the 'average' by weighting against the total votes at each polling place. We use 'weighted.mean' with 'w = TotalVotes' to get around this:

```{r average-swing}

two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = weighted.mean(Swing, w = TotalVotes))


```

# MOST IMPORTANT THING IN DATA SCIENCE IS TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE A REPRODUCABLE REPORT
# USING MARKDOWN AND KNITR IS THE BEST


```{r biggest-swing-coalition}

# Find the rows with the maximum swing
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  filter(Swing == max(Swing))

# Determine the elected party (ALP or Coalition) of each Division in 2013

elected_party_by_division_2013 = 
two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013 %>%
  group_by(DivisionNm) %>%
  summarise(Coalition_2PP = sum(`Liberal/National Coalition Votes`) / sum(TotalVotes) ) %>%
  mutate(Elected = if_else(Coalition_2PP > 0.5, 'Coalition', 'ALP')) # mutate adds a column


two_party_preferred_by_polling_place %>%
  inner_join(elected_party_by_division_2013)

```


### homework
### What polling place had the biggest swing AGINST the coalition
### 
### is inner join appropriate/ Should we use left/right/full join instead?
