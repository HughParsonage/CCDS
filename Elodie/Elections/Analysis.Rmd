## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Australia's 2016 election

```{r packages}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(dtplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)

```

The function `fread` comes from `data.table` package

```{r loadData}
two_party_prefered_by_polling_place <-
  fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-20499.csv")
  
```

#dplyr

##Basic Election Results

``` {r basic-analysis}
two_party_prefered_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = mean(Swing))
```

### Exercises:
1. Can you think of a better way to calculate the 'average' swing against the incumbent?
1. Can you think of a better way to calculate the 'average' swing?
2. Which polling place had the biggest swing against the Coalition?

We need to weight the average according to the number of votes cast at each polling place

```{r average-swing}
two_party_prefered_by_polling_place %>%
  summarise(avg_swing = weighted.mean(Swing, w = TotalVotes))
```

Recall that `summarise` takes a data frame and an expression like `LHS=RHS` where `LHS` is the column name and `RHS` is a function of the column names in the data, returning a data frame with a single column, `LHS` which has the value of the function `RHS`.

``` {r biggest-swing-Coalition}
two_party_prefered_by_polling_place %>%
  filter(Swing == max(Swing))
```

## 2013 election

### Exercise

1. Download the 2013 election polling place data. Create a new object 'two_party_preferred_by_polling_place_2013' containing the data.

``` {r 2013 data}

two_party_prefered_by_polling_place_2013 <- fread("http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/Downloads/HouseTppByPollingPlaceDownload-17496.csv")

```

2. Determine the elected party of each division in 2013

Take the dataset, `group_by` the division then `summarise` by adding up all the Liberal/Coalition votes (ensuring that we have backticks because the variable contains a slash and spaces) and dividing by the sum of the total votes. Then use `mutate` to add a colun and `if_else` to assign the elected party.

```{r elected-party-by-Division-2013}
elected_party_by_Division_2013 <- 
  two_party_prefered_by_polling_place_2013 %>%
  group_by(DivisionNm) %>%
  summarise(Coalition_2PP = sum(`Liberal/National Coalition Votes`) / sum(TotalVotes)) %>%
  mutate(elected = if_else(Coalition_2PP > 0.5, "Coalition", "ALP"))

```

```{r}
two_party_prefered_by_polling_place %>%
  inner_join(elected_party_by_Division_2013) %>% #right_join or a left_join for an outer join
  
```

### Homework
## What polling place had the biggest swing against the Coalition? (Note not division so you may need to amend the earlier code)
## Is inner_join appropriate? Should we use a left/right (outer) join instead?
